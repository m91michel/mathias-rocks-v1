- check the API of Fear & Gear Index. You can find the documentation [here]
- Create a new plugin. I used this plugin as starting point
- Adapt the API
- Reload plugin bitbar plugins
- Set up a suitable refresh time
- Create an base64 icon and insert it

Todo:

- maybe node js plugin would be great?
