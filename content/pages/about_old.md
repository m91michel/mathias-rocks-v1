Hi there! My name is Mathias Michel and I am a Software Developer specialized to Mobile and Web Frontend development. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science & Media from Technical University Nuremberg and I worked for [Jambit GmbH] for three years. I am now looking forward to new challenges.

Despite traveling the world and going to the gym I am interested in finance like Stocks, P2P & Cryptocurrencies. I love nice designs and a good UX in products which you can find for example in Apple products.

If you have feedback, questions, or just want to contact me? You can use the [contact form] or you can find me on
