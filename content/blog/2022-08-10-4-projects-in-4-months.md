Inspired by Peter Levels [12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) I decided to do ‚ÄúThe 4 projects in 4 months‚Äù challenge. My plan is to do a sabbatical and work full-time on my own projects for four months. This post describes why and what.

## Why I am doing this?

There are multiple reasons‚Ä¶

- Pursuing multiple ideas and figuring out what I enjoy the most. So one goal is to gain focus and more clarity for my next steps. (Obtain a target direction)
- I want to try new things and develop my skills or learn new ones. (education)
- Moving from dreaming and thinking into doing. (execution)
- Earn my first dollars (or euros) online. But this is not the main focus. (business)
- And of course just to try something new and have some fun.

## My constraints

- Focus on only one project per month
- Unlike other people, I will not travel during that time.
- From a finance perspective, I use the sabbatical model for cashflow and 4 months of full time
- Share progress and post on Twitter with #buildInPublic. Post every month a blog post where I document my progress.

## Which topics are planed?

### Month 1: [einfachcrypto.de](https://einfachcrypto.de/)

The first month will follow my passion - cryptocurrencies and blockchain! I started a side project last year ([einfachcrypto.de](https://einfachcrypto.de/)) and I have some pending ideas that I want to implement. For example, some content is still missing and I want to add utilities for the crypto research. This means I will split the month into sub-focus areas.

**Goal**

- Follow my heart topic and build utilities for myself and collect knowledge. The goal is also to help people and share information about cryptocurrencies.
- The goal is not to make money with this project but rather to grow an audience in this space.

### Month 2: Helping a friend with marketing and setup of tools

I am already supporting a friend with technical and marketing consulting. He started a health coaching business and wants to scale his business in October 2022. I will update his landing page, find a great webinar software and help him build a lead magnet like a free newsletter course.

**Goal**

- Increase knowledge in marking and building a course-based coaching course
- I will get a provision-based monetization, so this project is a potentially passive income stream

### Month 3: Building a Micro SaaS (Micro Software as a Service) business

I subscribed to the [Micro SaaS Idea](https://microsaasidea.substack.com/) newsletter. The idea is to pick one idea from this newsletter and build it. 

**Goal**

- Use my skillset to build my own business which can be a potentially passive income stream
- The first approaches fail mostly so the goal is to just start building SaaS. New ideas and insight will come along the way.

### Month 4: Open - No-code or MSaaS

I haven't made a final decision for this month because I want to have the flexibility to decide later. I have two options here. Either I build something with a no-code platform (e.g. bubble) or I start another micro SaaS business. Maybe I can also combine them and do both. ;) 

**Goal**
- I see a big potential in no-code. This will help me in my carrier and in my own business.
