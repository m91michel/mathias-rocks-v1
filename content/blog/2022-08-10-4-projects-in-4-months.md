Inspired by Peter Levels [12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) I decided to do the ‚Äú4 Projects in 4 Months‚Äù challenge. I plan to do a sabbatical and work full-time on my projects for four months. This blog post describes the reasons why and how I am doing this.

## Why am I doing this?

There are multiple reasons‚Ä¶

- **Clarity:** Pursue multiple ideas and figure out what I enjoy the most. Therefore, one goal is to be able to focus and clarify my next steps to obtain a target direction.
- **Education:** Try new things, improve my skills and learn new ones.
- **Execution:** Move from dreaming and thinking into doing.
- **Business:** Earn my first dollars (or euros) online. Nevertheless, this is not the main focus.
- **Fun:** And of course, just to try something new and have some fun.

## My constraints

- Focus only on one project per month
- Unlike other people, I will not travel during that time.
- From a finance perspective, I use the sabbatical model for cashflow and 4 months of full time
- Share progress and post on Twitter with #buildInPublic. Post every month a blog post where I document my progress.

## Which topics are planned?

### Month 1: Extend [einfachcrypto.de](https://einfachcrypto.de/)

The first month will follow my passion - cryptocurrencies and blockchain! I started a side project last year ([einfachcrypto.de](https://einfachcrypto.de/)) and I have some pending ideas that I want to implement. For example, some content is still missing and I want to add utilities for the crypto research. This means I will split the month into sub-focus areas.

**Goal**

- Follow my heart topic, build utilities for myself and collect knowledge. The goal is also to help people and share information about cryptocurrencies.
- The goal is not to make money with this project but rather to grow an audience within this space.

### Month 2: Helping a friend with marketing and setup of tools

I am already supporting a friend with technical and marketing consulting. He started a [health coaching business](https://alexander-wunsch.de/) and we want to scale his business in October 2022. I will update his landing page, find a great webinar software and help him build a lead magnet like a free newsletter course.

**Goal**

- Increase knowledge in marketing and building a course-based coaching
- I will get a provision-based monetization, so this project is a potentially passive income stream

### Month 3: Building a Micro SaaS (Micro Software as a Service) business

I subscribed to the [Micro SaaS Idea](https://microsaasidea.substack.com/) newsletter. The idea is to pick one idea from this newsletter and build it. 

**Goal**

- Use my skillset to build my own business including earning money.
- The first approaches fail mostly so the main goal is to start doing and get into building a SaaS. New ideas and insight will come along the way.

### Month 4: Open - no-code or MSaaS

I haven't made a final decision for this month because I want to have the flexibility to decide later. I have two options here. Either I build something with a no-code platform (e.g. [bubble](https://bubble.io/)) or I start another micro SaaS business from the newsletter. Maybe I can also combine them and do both. ;) 

**Goal**
- I see a big potential in no-code. This will help me in my carrier and in my own business.
